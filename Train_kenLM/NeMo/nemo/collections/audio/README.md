# Audio processing collection

The NeMo Audio Collection supports a range of models tailored for audio processing tasks, including single- and multi-channel speech enhancement and restoration.

* Mask-based speech processing: single-channel masking and guided source separation (GSS)
* Predictive speech processing: NCSN++
* Score-based generative models: SGMSE+
* Multi-channel audio processing: mask-based beamforming (MVDR) and dereverberation (WPE)
