    """A module to standardize the learning rate scheduler setup and configuration.

    This class decouples the learning rate scheduler from the model, similar to how the LightningDataModule

    for adding custom all-reduces, logging, early stopping, etc. Next to that standard Lightning callback-event,
    this also supports hooking into the Megatron forward-backward function at a granular level.
