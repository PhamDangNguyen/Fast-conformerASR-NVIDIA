# Speech Self-Supervised Learning

This directory contains example scripts to self-supervised speech models. 

There are two main types of supported self-supervised learning methods:
- [Wav2vec-BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06209): `speech_pre_training.py`
- [NEST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13106): `masked_token_pred_pretrain.py`
